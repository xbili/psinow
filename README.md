PSI Now
======

Displays the current 3-hour PSI status in Singapore due to the annual haze season. 

Built using Expressjs, jQuery. Backed by Twit, and Twitter API.

All data are pulled from @NEAsg's Twitter page. 
The tweets returned in JSON is then parsed by several functions and then returns the final 3-hour PSI value. 

Enjoy, and feel free to contribute! :)
